### Welcome to the Data Science Roadmap!

###### The Data Science Roadmap presented here serves as a comprehensive guide on GitHub, designed to provide a clear and structured path to face a problem in the field of data science. It is intended to be utilized as a valuable resource, enabling individuals to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of data science with ease. This roadmap breaks down the key areas of data science into easy-to-follow sections organized in folders. From fundamental concepts to advanced topics, every section of this roadmap has been carefully crafted to cover essential aspects of data science.

###### In this work the main phases of a data science project are presentes and organized as follows,
